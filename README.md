# foo
foo!

This should link to an issue: #1 (but no, github markdown sux. rST ftw!)

Let's try again, with an absolute URL: https://github.com/jamesodhunt/foo/issues/1.

And again, with a manually-shortened one: [\#1](https://github.com/jamesodhunt/foo/issues/1).

```sh
> echo hello
```

```sh
$ some sh commands
shell output
$ foo
bar
```

```bash
> echo hello
```

```bash
$ some bash commands
shell output
$ foo
bar
```

```sh-session
> echo hello
```

```sh-session
$ some bash commands
shell output
$ foo
bar
```
